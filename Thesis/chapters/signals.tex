% ADD IMAGE OF SIGNALS AND FIND PHASE REPRESENTATION
Those kind of signals listed before (electric, seismic and vibrational) are not inherently complex, differently, for example, of Magnetic Resonance Images, that are essentially magnetic momenta measured in the frequency domain. However, even for signals that have been registered in the time domain we can still recover the phase information encoded thanks to the \textit{Fourier Transform} $\mathcal{F}$.\\
Studying the problem in the frequency domain is a quite common approach to signal processing, since many operations in the time domain have a complex counterpart that sometimes turns out to be easier to perform (eg. differentiation and convolution). Furthermore, also from a purely theoretical point of view, several concepts are easier to derive and understand with complex notations.
