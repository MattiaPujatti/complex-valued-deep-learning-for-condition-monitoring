in appendix check if proof is fine or prefer changing it

in "extent" add images gradient descent
add plot most important activation functions / diverging sigmoid / real restriction of cardioid to relu
maybe add appendix with all plot of activation functions (+explain library cplot)

test stability on several datasets: * bad networks
				    * no regularization
				 
for Bonfiglioli: 
* compare different faults
* analysis of all dataset
* global average pooling?
* study feature maps / weights?

matrix of results:
- real/complex accuracy on all 120h datasets taken alone
- performances on all and all w multiplier signal

stats analysis (on all):
- confusion matrix
- fpr, tpr, roc curve?
- accuracy vs precision vs recall
- CAM and fault score?
