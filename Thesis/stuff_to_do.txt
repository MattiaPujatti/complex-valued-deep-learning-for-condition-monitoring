write introduction
write previous work
write thesis organization


in appendix check if proof is fine or prefer changing it

in "extent" add images gradient descent
add plot most important activation functions / diverging sigmoid / real restriction of cardioid to relu
maybe add appendix with all plot of activation functions (+explain library cplot)

test stability on several datasets: * bad networks
				    * no regularization
				 
for Bonfiglioli: 
* compare different faults
* analysis of all dataset
* global average pooling?
* study feature maps / weights?
