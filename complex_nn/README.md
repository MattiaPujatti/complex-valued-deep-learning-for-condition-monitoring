## Complex_nn

This small Python library, written on top of `JAX` and `dm-haiku`, has been realized in order to provide a fast implementation and run of a complex-valued neural network for classification tasks. It implements the main complex layers, activations and initializers discussed in the thesis project, together with high-level wrappers of more composite deep learning structures to train.
