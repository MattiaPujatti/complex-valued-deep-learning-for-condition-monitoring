## Complex-Valued Deep Learning for Condition Monitoring

Brief introduction.

### Abstract

At present, the vast majority of deep learning architectures are based on real-valued operations and representations. However, recent works and fundamental theoretical analyses suggest that complex numbers can have richer expressiveness: many deterministic wave signals, such as seismic, electrical, or vibrational, contain information in their phase, which risks being lost when studied using a real-valued model. However, despite their attractive properties and potential, only recently complex-valued algorithms have started to be introduced in the deep neural networks frameworks.
In this work, we move forward in this direction developing and implementing a coherent and working structure to train complex-valued models, remaining rigorous from a mathematical perspective but, at the same time, seeking for stability and accuracy of the training process.
As a first application of this solution, we show the results obtained applying complex-valued deep neural networks for condition monitoring in industrial applications. Different Deep Network architectures have been trained on vibrational signals extracted from sensors attached to gearmotors to detect failures. Finally, we compare the performances obtained with real and complex-valued neural networks.

### Thesis organization

The thesis is organized into two big parts: part I is dedicated to the theoretical analysis and implementation of a complex-valued deep learning framework, while part II proceed implementing, in details, such methodology to a real-world problem, i.e. condition monitoring in industrial applications. 
In particular:
* in chapter 2 there is a brief theoretical introduction of complex analysis, with particular attention given to the notions of complex differentiability and circularity; also, the theoretical advantages that complex-valued deep learning should provide over the real counterpart are introduced.
* in chapter 3, the project continues with a more precise formulation of the framework that is trying to build, first examining a working complex backpropagation algorithm, and then with some possible extents, in the complex domain, of the most common machine learning layers and activations.
* in chapter 4 a practical implementation of the operations defined is provided, together with the comparison with an equivalent real-valued procedure; there is also an interesting section examining the impact of the circularity quotient when training complex models.
* in chapter 5, the framework developed will be tested over a real world situation, i.e. the problem of condition monitoring in industrial applications; in particular, it will work over datasets of vibration signals, provided by Bonfiglioli, an important gearmotors producer, comparing the effective performances achieved with both real and complex-valued models.
* in chapter 6, finally, it will be proposed an of a known domain adaptation algorithm that seems to be easily extendable also in the complex domain.

### Important Clarification

Unfortunately, Bonfiglioli S.P.A. didn't allow us to make public the results obtained using their data, and so we had to censor a few important sections in this thesis. For those parts, you can only trust our words.

### Main Results achieved



* The domain adaptation algorithm known as [`Wasserstein Distance Guided Representation Learning (WDGRL)`](https://arxiv.org/abs/1707.01217) can be extended, with good performances, also in the complex domain. That's because the metric used (the [Wasserstein distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wasserstein_metric)) can be extended also in $`\mathds{C}`$.

### Acknowledgement

This work has been inspired by the PHD thesis of Patrick Virtue "[Complex-valued Deep Learning with Applications to Magnetic Resonance Image Synthesis](https://www2.eecs.berkeley.edu/Pubs/TechRpts/2019/EECS-2019-130.html)", from which we took some fundamental ideas behind the framework development, and that we expanded into different directions. 
Furthermore, we provide a more modern implementation of complex-valued layers, activations, optimizers and initializers, based on Python, and not on Caff√®.
